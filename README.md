<h1>Deploying a web server with Azure virtual machines</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project involved the end-to-end deployment of a web server on an Ubuntu Virtual Machine within Microsoft Azure. The objective was to gain practical experience with Azure's fundamental networking services, including virtual networks, subnets, and security groups, while also implementing secure remote access via Azure Bastion and configuring public accessibility through IP publishing and DNS labeling. The project culminated in the installation and configuration of Nextcloud, a popular web application.
<h3>Tasks performed</h3>

- <b>Successfully provisioned a fundamental Azure networking infrastructure, including a Resource Group, Virtual Network, and subnet, to host a web server.</b>
  
- <b>Implemented network security best practices by configuring a Network Security Group to protect the subnet and control inbound/outbound traffic.</b>
  
- <b>Created an Ubuntu Server Virtual Machine within the Azure environment, gaining experience with Linux server deployment.</b>
  
- <b>Installed and configured Nextcloud, a web-based file sharing and collaboration platform, on the Ubuntu server via secure SSH connection using Bastion.</b>
  
- <b>Configured public access to the web server by publishing an IP address and ensuring the HTTPS port was accessible.</b>

- <b>Established a user-friendly access point by creating a DNS label for the deployed web server.</b>

- <b>Developed a practical understanding of essential Azure services and their role in building secure and scalable cloud infrastructure.</b>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

- Azure
- Nextcloud
